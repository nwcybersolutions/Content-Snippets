Create reusable content snippets you can easily drop into any content area on your site.

== Description ==

Create reusable content snippets as easily as creating a post. Once they're created, you can drop them into any content area on your site using the **Add Post Element** button. (This is created by the *Shortcake (Shortcode UI)* plugin, which is required for Content Snippets.)

If you know the snippet's post ID you can also insert it with a simple shortcode:

\[snippet id="123"\]

== Installation ==

**Please note:** the *Shortcake (Shortcode UI)* plugin is currently required for this plugin to work properly. (The functionality of that plugin is slated to be incorporated into WordPress core in a future release.)
